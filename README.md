<h1>Rhythmic is yet another rhythm game, it can read StepMania 5 files.</h1>
I wanted to create a basic rhythm game that was able to read existing step files from other popular games so that I didn't have to worry about compatability issues. This is still a work in progress, so please do not assume this is a perfect re-creation of StepMania.<br><br>
Currently it can scan for a song folder, create a list of files that appear in game, which you can click on to see information about each song. You can then select the song to play, where it will place down all the notes of the song and allow you to play along.<br><br>
Please enjoy!
