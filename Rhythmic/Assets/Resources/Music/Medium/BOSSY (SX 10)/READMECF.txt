Production Notes from Roger Clark ("Quad Star System"):

> Fantastic World is inspired by positive spirit of dance games.
> Modern ITG is strongly tied to the early-to-mid 2010s EDM movement,
> so I tried to blend elements of �kawaii future bass�, complextro-style
> electro house and "dance game music together" into a kind of ending
> credits song for Season 1 of the Club Fantastic project.
>
> The song is written in E Major, the relative major mode to Utopia's
> C# Minor. For me, Utopia will always exemplify what made
> In The Groove and Kyle Ward's music unique.
>
> Thanks to xaimus for encouraging me to finish the song,
> MegaSphere for mastering work, nanobii for arrangement advice,
> Robert Robinson, Chris Chike and Luke Wagman for listening to
> early demos, as well as Telperion, Ash, Freyja and the rest of the
> Club Fantastic team for feedback.

> something that distilled my experience of growing up in Appalachia
> as a 90s gamer and DDR player. When we started Club Fantastic, it
> motivated me into finishing the song -- Melody Mountain is the first
> track I've ever completed.
